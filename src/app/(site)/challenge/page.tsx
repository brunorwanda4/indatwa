          The public schools in Africa are characterized by devastating
          conditions and overcrowding, which do not allow for effective
          learning. In South Africa, for instance, over 8,000 public schools
          need over 2 million USD to fix conditions that have seen some
          classrooms have as many as 139 pupils. This makes it hard for pupils
          to ask questions and understand their daily lessons, which makes them
          lose interest in furthering their studies.

          In addition, most learning systems focus more on theoretical knowledge
          compared to practical knowledge, which means the students lack
          exposure to the modern world. Basic needs, such as the type of food to
          be taken to school, act as a challenge, especially in Rwanda, where
          parents cannot afford 3,000 Rwandans per meal. In addition, the lack
          of technology for practical knowledge, especially for science-related
          courses, means the students can only learn theoretical concepts.

          The gender biases and traditional laws have been systematic in nature
          and have hindered women from moving into senior positions such as
          Principal or Head of Department. The inhibiting factors are often
          backed by religious constraints and biological excuses that hinder
          women from achieving their professional aspirations. In spite of these
          hurdles, women in leadership positions have been proven effective in
          enhancing school environments and procuring vital resources via
          strategic corporate partnerships.
